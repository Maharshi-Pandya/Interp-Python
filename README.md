## Interpreter with python

- This is an attempt to make a simple interpreter for PASCAL in python
- Currently it supports arthimetic operation interpretation only.
- More features to be added

(As the code grows, will start chopping it up into individual files/modules)

### Usage 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Maharshi-Pandya/Interp-Python.git
$ cd Interp-Python
$ python3 interp.py
```
Once this is done, input prompt will be generated.

Eg.

```
calc> ((4 + 2.77) ** 2 / 33.01)
1.3884550136322327
```
